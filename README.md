# SalamanderGrowth
This repository holds the novel code to model individual growth and estimate age-at-length of plethodontid salamanders using a von Bertalanffy (VB) growth function to individual body size data using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach that accounts for measurement error. 

Also in this repository is the modified code from Tenan et al. 2014 and Sacarro et al. 2020 to estimate population growth rates for stream salamanders using a reverse-time Pradel model. 

This code was used to analyze data in "Individual growth rates and size at metamorphosis increase with watershed area in a stream salamander." 

Capture-recapture data from contiguous reaches available at https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/cd5f5a03df194930bf87eb12157b8182. Watershed area for contiguous reaches available within this repository.
Capture-recapture data from isolated reaches and watershed area data available at https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/ffbfabdc30d79553e24207dcfec061a6.
Discharge data available at https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/87584eda806dd5a480423b6bfefec577.
