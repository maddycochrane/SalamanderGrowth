# SalamanderGrowth
This repository holds the novel code to model individual growth and estimate age-at-length of plethodontid salamanders using a von Bertalanffy (VB) growth function to individual body size data using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach that accounts for measurement error. This code was used to analyze data in "Effect of longitudinal stream location on salamander life history and population growth." 

Also in this repository is the modified code from Tenan et al. 2014 and Sacarro et al. 2020 to estimate population growth rates for salamander populations across a range of watershed areas.
