# SalamanderGrowth
This repository holds the novel code to model growth and estimate age-at-length of plethodontid salamanders using a von Bertalanffy (VB) growth function to individual body size data using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach that accounts for measurement error. This code was used to analyze data in "Streamflow affects life history in a headwater salamander."
